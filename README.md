IOT based pollution measuring device

ABSTRACT

Air pollution has had devastating impacts on public health and environment, hence it has become a major concern especially in urban areas. A real-time system is essential because conventional systems are not scalable resulting in limited data of pollution levels available to us for detailed research. The need is for a gadget which can sense the level of pollutants at any time instant and help us know about the condition of the vehicles. This project of ours aims to automate the process of checking quantity of pollutants in cars and send data to a website using local Wi-Fi for regular analysis of pollution levels as well as storing that data for future reference. The real time analysis is the need of the hour and we strive to achieve that aim through this project. The device has been created to be of aid to the environment and the society.
